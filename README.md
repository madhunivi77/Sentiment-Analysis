# Sentiment-Analysis
## Description
This project implements a sentiment analysis model to classify tweets into positive or negative sentiments. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation using various machine learning techniques.
## Features
- Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of sentiments.

- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data for analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize the most frequent words in each sentiment category.

- Model Training: Train the sentiment analysis models using techniques like Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression.

- Evaluation: Evaluate the models' performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- Prediction: Use the trained models to predict the sentiment of new text samples.
