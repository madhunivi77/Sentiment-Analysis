# Sentiment-Analysis
## Description
This project implements a sentiment analysis model to classify tweets into positive or negative sentiments. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation using various machine learning techniques.
## Features
- Data preprocessing including cleaning and normalization of text data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using word clouds and frequency distributions.
- Implementation of machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.
- Evaluation of models using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
-```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn nltk matplotlib scikit-learn wordcloud
```

# Usage
- Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of sentiments.

- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data for analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize the most frequent words in each sentiment category.

- Model Training: Train the sentiment analysis models using techniques like Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression.

- Evaluation: Evaluate the models' performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- Prediction: Use the trained models to predict the sentiment of new text samples.
